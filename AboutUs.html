            <p> (Doc and Marty are going to try out the model train to make sure that everything will work out.) Here you go, Marty. Connect that to the positive terminal. All right, Marty, you all set? Yeah, yeah, go. Train pulling out of the station! Coming up the switch track! Stop at switch track! Throw switch! Pulling up the Delorean! Pushing the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour! (the model train falls off the table with the model car and onto a pillow on the ground. Doc catches the model Delorean before it hits the ground.) It couldn't be simpler! (There is a knock on the door.)(The Mayor starts the clock.) Let the festivities begin! (Doc and Marty are watching all this happen from a few yards away.) Y'know Marty, in a way it's fitting that you and I are here to witness this. Too bad I didn't bring my camera.(aside to Marty) The only problem is we'll never be able to show it to anybody. Smile, Doc. (There is a big flash and Marty and Doc stand there like they're blind.) (The Festival) (An old time band is playing.)What's with the life preserver? (Marty looks down at his jacket vest.) I just wanna use the phone. Yeah, it's in the back. (goes and looks through the white pages in the phone book) Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. (He tries calling but there's no answer. So he goes over to the bar.) Do you know where 1640 Riverside…The flux capacitor. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Uh, plutonium, (lowers the camera) wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?(in an awed whisper) It erased.</p>  
    
            <p>Hey Marty, Marty, I wanna show you these new matchbooks for my auto detailing I had printed up... (he sees the DeLorean begin to fly off.) A flying DeLorean? (The DeLorean flies off down the street, turns around, and heads towards the camera before disappearing into the future, leaving trails of fire behind in the sky.) What the hell is going on here? (Hill Valley – 2015) (Three sonic booms are heard and then the DeLorean arrives in the future right in the middle of a skyway. Marty and Jennifer scream as the DeLorean almost collides with a Taxi.)Why Mr Strickland, it's nice to see you sir. Is that liquor I smell, Tannen? Uh, I wouldn't know, I don't know what liquor smells like 'coz I'm too young to drink it. I see. And what have we here? Sports statistics, interesting subject. Homework, Tannen? No, it ain't homework, 'coz, uh, I'm ain't at home.Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that just caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I figure, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse. (realizing) That's eighty dollars! Look, if your horse threw his shoe, bring him back and I'll re-shoe him! I done shot that horse! Well that's your problem, Tannen!Yes it's me, Marty. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just that you're so, you're so big. Everything's going to be fine, Marty. Are you hungry? I can call room service. Room service? (o.s) Lorraine!(v.o) Yeah, this could get heavy Doc. (mutters to himself) Heavy, heavy. (w.t) Whatever happens, you must not let your other self see you. The consequences could be disastrous. Excuse me, sir. Yes, you with the hat. (1985 Doc pulls down his hat so that the 1955 Doc won’t recognize him.) Who me?Nice set of wheels. Let's see what she can do...next green light. No thanks. What's the matter? Chicken? (grabbing Marty's hand) Marty...don't. Grab a hold of something.</p>
