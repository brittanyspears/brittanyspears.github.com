                        <p>Hey, Doc...where ya goin' now? Back to the future? From the cab window, he shakes his head. Nope. Already been there! (he waves at Marty and Jennifer) (Marty and Jennifer wave back, and the time train rises into the air and suddenly gains speed and disappears. The screen blackens and we see...THE END.)Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. (Doc takes the picture with a pair of tongs and looks at it.) Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. (He tosses the photo back at Marty.)Whoa, whoa, okay. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Right check, Doc. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. You have this thing hooked up to the car?(in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train. Here's to ya, blacksmith. (He raises his glass in salute.)(Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.) Doc! Doc! (Realizing that Doc isn't there he runs back outside. He looks around and spots the Saloon.) (Saloon)Flux capacitor. It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works. Bet your ass it works. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Okay Doc, this is it.</p>
